Description:
This GeoJSON dataset was generated from the MBTA’s GTFS feed. It contains transit stop information for the MBTA network, including stop locations, names, and related attributes. The data—extracted from the GTFS stops.txt file and enriched with route associations—was converted into GeoJSON format using the gtfs-to-geojson tool. Stops with the same 'stop_name', 'zone_id', and 'stop_url' were filtered, i.e. only the first entry has been kept. Through this process, we removed 569 stops to ease your analysis. The original file has the same shape but retains all
