Description:
This GeoJSON dataset was generated from the MBTAâ€™s GTFS feed. It contains transit route data represented as multiline geometries. Each feature corresponds to a transit route served by the MBTA, with associated attributes including route names, descriptions, colors, and URLs. The data is derived from the GTFS routes.txt file and converted into a GeoJSON MULTILINESTRING format using the gtfs-to-geojson tool. In the deduplicated version, we removed the lines with duplicated `route_long_name` fields (3 routes).
